Is there an API useage file? I'm not sure, so I'm writing this for my own use:
device.write("*RST")
Resets the device. It turns output off, and puts everything in a default.
set_frequency(freq)
sets a frequency.
object.ask("*IDN?")
Verifies the ID

set wave type:
set_wave_type(wave_type)
wave type options:
Wave types:
SIN
SQU
RAMP
PULS
NOIS
DC
USER

I had issues with setting my device using:
device = usbtmc.Instrument("Agilent Technologies", "33220A")
but 
device = usbtmc.Instrument(0x0957, 0x0407)
works. This was taken using lsusb in linux:
Bus 001 Device 020: ID 0957:0407 Agilent Technologies, Inc. 33220A Waveform Generator
python does't know what to do with leading zeros, this API has no 
checks for that, just us the 0x hex specifyer.
